        I'm currently a CS student at the University of San Francisco with experience in Java, .NET, React, and more. 
        I enjoy building software that makes life easier and more interesting. Whether itâ€™s a frontend experience or backend logic, 
        I love tackling complex challenges with clean, efficient solutions.
